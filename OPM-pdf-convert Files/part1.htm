But the intermediaries in many respects do serve an important function, and we can hold them accountable…Apart from the legality issue, in my view it is untenable to allow an unregulated, unlicensed derivatives market to compete, side-by-side, with a fully regulated and licensed derivatives market. In addition to the absence of market safeguards and customer protections in the unregulated market, it is unfair to impose the obligations, restrictions, and costs of regulation upon some market participants while permitting their unregulated competitors to operate wholly free of such obligations, restrictions, and costs.”</a></div><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="../OPM%20Overview%208-10-21LV.html">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../OPM%20Overview%208-10-21LV.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part2.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
